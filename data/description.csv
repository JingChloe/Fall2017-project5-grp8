dog breed,breed description
affenpinscher,"The affenpinscher is square-proportioned, compact and sturdy, with medium bone. It is a smaller version of a working terrier, and as such is not a delicate dog. This is an active, tough dog that is agile enough to catch and dispatch rats and mice. Its gait is light, sound and confident. The affenpinscher has a monkeylike facial expression with long eyebrows and beard, which lends it an air of comic seriousness. This breed's rough coat is about 1 inch long on its body and somewhat longer on its head, neck, chest, stomach and legs. "
afghan hound,"The Afghan is built along greyhound-like lines, enabling it to execute a double-suspension gallop and run-down fleet game. The comparatively short back and steep pelvis helped it to leap great heights and to turn almost in place, essential attributes for coursing in rocky mountainous terrain. The large feet gave it a better foothold and were more resistant to injury on rough ground. The silky coat protected the dog from cold nights at high altitudes. The Afghan appears dignified and aloof, with an exotic expression and proud carriage. This dog's gait shows great elasticity and spring; the Afghan moves with its head and tail high."
african hunting dog,"The African hunting dog is a highly social animal, living in packs with separate dominance hierarchies for males and females. Uniquely among social carnivores, it is the females rather than the males that scatter from the natal pack once sexually mature, and the young are allowed to feed first on carcasses. The species is a specialised diurnal hunter of antelopes, which it catches by chasing them to exhaustion. Like other canids, it regurgitates food for its young, but this action is also extended to adults, to the point of being the bedrock of African wild dog social life.It has few natural predators, though lions are a major source of mortality, and spotted hyenas are frequent kleptoparasites."
airedale,"Known as the King of Terriers, the Airedale is indeed the largest of all terriers. The dog breed originated in the Aire Valley of Yorkshire, and was created to catch otters and rats in the region between the Aire and Wharfe Rivers. An able sporting dog, he became an ideal working dog as well, proving his worth during World War I. Intelligent, outgoing, and confident, the Airedale possesses a wonderful playful streak that delights his owners"
american staffordshire terrier,"This stocky dog should be muscular, giving the impression not only of great strength for its size but also of grace and agility. Its gait is springy. Its low center of gravity helped it stay on its feet in a fight, and its nimbleness helped it avoid its opponent's teeth. Its own jaws are strong with great power. Its coat is short, close and glossy.Typically docile and playful with its family, the American Staffordshire terrier is also generally friendly toward strangers as long as its owners are present. It is generally very good with children. It is a protective breed and can be aggressive toward other dogs especially those that challenge it. It is stubborn, tenacious and fearless. For all of its tough persona, the most important thing in life to this breed is its owner's fond attention."
appenzeller,"The Appenzeller originated as an all-around farm dog breed, who stayed busy herding the livestock, guarding the farm, and pulling carts in his native Switzerland. Today's Appenzellers have still got the energy, smarts, and self-confidence that makes for valuable working dogs but they're anything but low-maintenance. Dogs of this breed need lots of exercise, training, and a job to do."
australian terrier,"The Australian terrier is small, sturdy and medium-boned; it is long in proportion to height. This is a working terrier that should exhibit a ground-covering gait and hard condition. Its weatherproof coat is made up of a short, soft undercoat and a harsh, straight, outer coat, about 2.5 inches long, shorter on the tail and lower legs. It sports a ruff around the neck and a topknot of longer hair adds to its keen, intelligent expression.One of the quieter terriers, the Aussie is nonetheless a plucky, tough character, ready to go after a rodent when the chance arises. It is fun-loving and adventurous, and needs daily exercise to keep it from becoming frustrated. It is clever and generally eager to please, making it one of the more obedient terriers. It gets along fairly well with other dogs and household pets. It is reserved with strangers. Reflecting its earth dog heritage, it does like to dig."
basenji,"The basenji is square-proportioned and high on leg. It is far more slightly built and longer-legged than most other primitive breeds, giving it a good amount of speed and the ability to perform the double-suspension gallop. Its erect ears help it locate prey in thick bush and may act as heat dissipaters. Its short coat also aids in dealing with the hot climate of Africa.Some consider the basenji to have terrier-like mannerisms because it is feisty for a hound. More often it is considered catlike in mannerisms: clever, inquisitive, stubborn, independent and reserved. Its hunting roots are very evident, as it loves to chase and trail. It needs regular mental and physical stimulation, lest it become frustrated and destructive. Basenjis may be barkless, but they are not mute. They do make a sort of yodel, howl and shriek and occasionally bark, but just one or two ""fox barks"" at a time."
basset,"The Basset dog breed was bred for hunting small game such as rabbits and is still used for this purpose in some parts of the country. When he's not on the trail of a bunny, he's a laid-back family friend who loves kids."
beagle,"The beagle should look like a miniature foxhound, solid for its size. The beagle's moderate size enables it to be followed on foot. It can also be carried to the hunt, and once there, can scurry around in thick underbrush. Its close hard coat protects it from underbrush. Its moderate build enables it to nimbly traverse rough terrain. The beagle's amiable personality allows it to get along with other dogs and to be a successful pack hunter. The beagle is noted for its melodious bay, which helps hunters locate it from a distance.One of the most amiable hounds, the beagle was bred as a pack hunter and needs companionship, whether human or canine. It loves to explore the outdoors and is an enthusiastic trailer. Given adequate exercise, it is a calm, tractable house pet. It is an excellent child's dog, gentle, incredibly tolerant and always ready to join in a game or an adventure. It is an independent breed, however, and may run off if a trail beckons. It barks and howls."
bedlington terrier,"This graceful, lithe dog has a distinctive silhouette. Its arched loin and racy outline give it great speed and agility. A wolf in lamb's clothing, the Bedlington is unrivaled in its ability to chase and fight agile but tough quarry. Its gait is light and springy. Its coat is a mixture of hard and soft hair standing off the skin, affording good protection as well as outstanding appearance.The Bedlington is among the softer terriers, not only in looks and feel but in temperament. It is companionable, demonstrative and loyal. It enjoys its creature comforts and is a fairly quiet house dog. Even though it will seldom initiate a fight, it will not allow itself to be intimidated by other dogs and can be a scrappy fighter when pushed. It will give chase to small animals outdoors, but it can usually coexist with them indoors."
bernese mountain dog,"The Bernese mountain dog is slightly longer than tall, though it appears square. It is a sturdy, large, hardy dog capable of both draft and droving work. This requires a combination of strength, speed and agility. Its natural working gait is a slow trot, but with good reach and drive. Its thick coat is moderately long, and slightly wavy or straight, providing insulation from the cold. Its expression is gentle, and its coloring is striking.The Bernese mountain dog is an easygoing, calm family companion (that is, after it leaves its adolescent stage). It is sensitive, loyal and extremely devoted. It is gentle with children and often reserved with strangers. It generally gets along well with other dogs and pets."
black-and-tan coonhound,"The black and tan coonhound's moderate build gives it a blend of strength, speed and agility. It is square or slightly longer than tall, with moderate bone. Its long ears may help stir up ground scents. Its deep muzzle allows room for olfactory apparatus. Its deep voice enables the hunter to locate the dog when it has treed its quarry. Its hair is short but dense, providing an all-weather-protective coat. Its expression is alert, friendly and eager. Its stride is easy and graceful, with head and tail held high.Not the prototypical house dog, the black and tan coonhound, nonetheless, makes an exemplary pet. It is mellow, amiable, calm and unobtrusive indoors. Outdoors, its strong hunting instincts take over, and it can be difficult, if not impossible, to turn from a track after it starts trailing. As befitting a dog with its heritage, the black and tan is strong, independent and stubborn. It is gentle and tolerant with children, but it may be too independent to satisfy a playful child. It is reserved with strangers."
blenheim spaniel,"Although he is born to be a companion, the Blenheim Spanieldog breed retains the sporty nature of his spaniel ancestors. If he's not sitting on a lap or getting a belly rub, nothing makes him happier than to flush a bird and then attempt to retrieve it. One of the largest of the toy breeds, he's often as athletic as a true sporting breed and enjoys hiking, running on the beach, and dog sports such as agility, flyball and rally. Some have even shown their prowess as hunting dogs. The more restful members of the breed find success as family friends and therapy dogs."
bloodhound,"The bloodhound is a steadfast trailer, built for endurance rather than speed. Its skin is thin and loose, falling in wrinkles around its head and throat. Its long ears are supposed to stir up scents as the ears rake along the ground, and its profuse wrinkles are said to trap the odors around the face, although neither of these assertions has ever been scientifically verified. Its dense short coat protects it from being caught in brambles. Its docile temperament makes it nonthreatening to the humans it is sometimes now called upon to trail. Its gait is elastic and free, with tail held high. Its expression is noble and dignified.For all its calm manners at home, the bloodhound is a tireless trailer once on the track. It is tough, stubborn and independent, yet it is so gentle and placid that it is extremely trustworthy around children although it may not be playful enough for some children's needs. Nonetheless, it is not the lazy ol' hound dog portrayed in folklore but instead an active, playful companion. Although not the easiest breed to train for traditional obedience, it is exceptionally easy to train in tasks involving trailing. The bloodhound is reserved with strangers."
bluetick,"Bluetick Coonhounds are speedy and compact nocturnal hunters named for the mottled (or ticked) black-and-blue pattern of the glossy coat. A small female might stand 21 inches at the shoulder and weigh 45 pounds; a large male can top out at 27 inches and 80 pounds. Blueticks are well-muscled but sleek and racy, never chunky or clumsy. The baying, bawling, and chopping bark of Bluetick Coonhounds in hot pursuit might sound cacophonous to some, but to coon hunters it's the music of the night."
border collie,"This is a medium dog of strong bone, slightly longer than it is tall, combining grace, agility, substance and stamina. Its trot is smooth, ground-covering and tireless, moving with stealth and strength. It is able to change speed and direction suddenly. Border collies must be able to display incredible agility even after working for long periods. The coat can be either smooth or rough. The smooth coat is short all over the body; the rough coat is medium to long in length and flat to slightly wavy in texture. Its expression is intelligent, alert, eager and full of interest, a reflection of its temperament.The border collie is a bundle of mental and physical energy awaiting its chance to be unleashed on the world. Among the most intelligent and obedient of breeds, it is nonetheless a disastrous house dog if it is not given a challenging job every day. Given sufficient exercise, it is a dependable and loyal companion. It is intent on whatever it does and tends to stare, which can be unnerving to other animals. It also likes to chase other animals. It is reserved, even protective, toward strangers."
border terrier,"The border terrier is of medium bone, slightly taller than long. Its long legs impart the speed, agility and endurance necessary to follow a horse over all sorts of terrain, whereas its fairly narrow body allows it to squeeze through narrow passages in pursuit of a fox. Its gait displays good length of stride. Its coat consists of a short, dense undercoat covered by a very wiry, straight, somewhat broken outer coat, which should conform to the body. Its hide is very thick and loose fitting, affording protection from the bites of its quarry. The border is known for its distinctive otter head, and its alert expression matches its alert demeanor.One of the few terriers bred to run with the pack, the border is one of the most amiable and tractable of the group. It is inquisitive, busy, friendly and biddable. It does like to hunt and can be independent, ingredients that make for a dog that may tend to roam if given the chance. It is generally good with other dogs and cats, but not with rodents. It is very good with children and makes a good companion for people of all ages. It digs, and some bark. Some are talented escape artists."
borzoi,"The borzoi is a running hound capable of hunting large, fierce game in a very cold climate. As such, it retains the greyhound build necessary for running at great speed, but it is larger and stronger than the greyhound. Its jaws should be strong enough to hold down a wolf. The long, silky coat, which can be either flat, wavy or rather curly, provides protection against cold weather and snow. Borzois should possess elegance and grace, with flowing lines, whether standing or moving.A breed of quiet elegance, the borzoi exemplifies the well-mannered house dog. Outdoors, it races with wild abandon, and it will chase any small animal that runs. It is independent but very sensitive. Although generally good with children, it may not be playful enough to satisfy some children. Some can be timid. It is reserved with strangers."
boston bull,"Boston Terriers have been popular since their creation a little more than a century ago. They were originally bred to be fighting dogs, but today, they're gentle, affectionate companions with tuxedo-like markings that earned them the nickname American Gentleman."
bouvier des flandres,"The Bouvier des Flandres was originally bred to be a versatile farm dog. He helped farmers in a multitude of tasks, including herding livestock (particularly cattle), pulling carts, and guarding. The hard-working and intelligent Bouvier is still an ideal farm dog, as well as a capable service, assistance, law enforcement, and guard dog. And while you can also find him competing in obedience, agility, and herding trials, serving as family companion is the role that seems to suit him best."
boxer,"The boxer is exemplary in its combination of stylish elegance with strength and agility. It is square-proportioned with good substance and musculature. Its stride is free and ground-covering, with proud carriage. Its head is distinctive, with a broad, blunt muzzle and alert expression. Its coat is short and shiny. It is perfectly suited to serve as a working watchdog.The boxer is playful, exuberant, inquisitive, attentive, demonstrative, devoted and outgoing; it is a perfect companion for an active family. It can be stubborn, but it is sensitive and responsive to commands. It may be aggressive toward strange dogs, but it is generally good with other household dogs and pets."
brabancon griffon,"Originally bred to hunt and kill rats, this former Belgian street dog is a distinctive and unusual dog breed. Although he's small, he's hardly a pampered pooch. Affectionate and lively, his intelligence, sense of humor, and air of self-importance keep him one step ahead of his people. They adore him anyway."
briard,"The briard is square or slightly longer than it is tall and powerful without being course; the overall appearance is one of handsome form. Like all good herding dogs, it combines strength, flexibility, agility and endurance with the ability to make abrupt turns, springing starts and sudden stops. Its movement has been described as ""quicksilver,"" with supple, light strides that give the impression of gliding. Its undercoat is fine and tight, and its outer coat is coarse and dry, lying flat in long, slightly wavy locks. On the shoulders, the coat's length is 6 inches or more. The questioning, confident expression is enhanced by the longer eyebrows, as well as the long-appearing head.Devoted and faithful, the briard is a loving and protective companion. It is independent, intelligent and self-assured, but it is also willing to please and eager to serve as a partner in adventure. It is reserved with strangers. It can be aggressive with other dogs and may nip at people's heels when playing. It tends to stay at home and may attempt to keep the family's children home as well!"
brittany spaniel,"Brittanys were bred as gundogs, and they definitely have birds on the brain. Although they're often called Brittany Spaniels, the American Kennel Club dropped the word _spaniel from this pointing breed's name in 1982. The energetic Brittany is a versatile family companion and hunting dog who works more closely to the hunter than other pointing breeds."
bull mastiff,"This nearly square breed should be powerful and active a combination of strength, endurance and alertness. It should appear to be 60 percent mastiff and 40 percent bulldog. Its gait is smooth and powerful, but its angulation is moderate. Its coat is short and dense, and its expression keen and alert. These attributes allowed the bullmastiff to both overtake and over-power intruders.The mastiff is innately good-natured, calm, easygoing and surprisingly gentle. It is a well-mannered house pet, but it needs sufficient room to stretch out. This is an extremely loyal breed, and though not excessively demonstrative, it is devoted to its family and good with children."
cairn,"The Cairn Terrier dog breed is a small working terrier developed on the Isle of Skye in Scotland. Farmers used him to rid their property of vermin, and they needed a dog with courage, tenacity, and intelligence  characteristics still found in today's Cairn. He is a sensible, independent, and friendly dog who excels as a family companion."
cardigan,"The Cardigan Welsh Corgi is the older of the two Corgi dog breeds, with dogs of this type believed to have existed in Wales for more than 3,000 years.

He loves to spend time with his family and is an active, fun-loving playmate for school-age children. The Cardigan's medium-length coat comes in many colors and patterns, including red, brindle, blue merle and black, usually with white markings."
chesapeake bay retriever,"The Chesapeake Bay retriever was developed to hunt waterfowl under adverse conditions, facing strong tides in rough water, high winds and sometimes even having to break through ice. It is an extraordinary swimmer, with a strong, yet tender, bite enabling it to carry birds. It has powerful limbs and webbed feet. The Chessie is slightly longer than tall, with its hindquarters as high, or higher, than its forequarters. Its coat is rendered virtually waterproof by virtue of its oily, harsh outer coat and dense wooly undercoat. The color matches its working surroundings: any shade of brown, sedge or dead grass.The Chesapeake Bay retriever is hardy enough to not only withstand, but also relish, repeated plunges into icy water. It loves to swim and retrieve. Despite an active life when outdoors, inside it tends to be calm. The Chessie tends to be independent, although it is eager to learn. It is reserved with strangers and can be protective; it also can be aggressive toward strange dogs if challenged. This is the hardiest, most strong-willed and protective of the retriever breeds."
chihuahua,"The Chihuahua is graceful, small and compact; it is slightly longer than it is tall. It has a saucy expression and an alert, terrier-like attitude. It should move out at a swift pace with good reach and drive. Its coat can be smooth, with soft, glossy hair or long, with soft straight or wavy hair and fringed ears.The saucy Chihuahua has earned its place as a favored toy dog because of its intense devotion to a single person. It is reserved with strangers but good with other household dogs and pets. Some try to be protective, but they are not very effective. Some may be quite bold; others may be timid. It is often temperamental. Some bark."
chow,"This distinctive-looking dog breed has a proud, independent spirit that some describe as catlike. He can be aloof if you're looking for a cuddle buddy, this probably isn't the best breed for you and downright suspicious of strangers. But for the right person, he's a fiercely loyal companion."
clumber,"The clumber spaniel is a long, low dog, rectangular in shape and with massive bone. This build, in combination with a deep chest, heavy brow and powerful hindquarters, enables the dog to move through thick underbrush when hunting. The coat is straight, flat, soft and dense, imparting resistance to weather. The white color helps the hunter locate the dog. The clumber tends to hunt close. It moves easily, tending to roll slightly because of its wide body and short legs. The expression is soft.Among the most low-keyed and easygoing of sporting breeds, the clumber spaniel is nonetheless a hunter at heart, ever ready for a day in the field. At home it tends to be quiet and may even need to be goaded into exercise. It is one of the few sporting breeds suitable for city life, although it will relish walks and outings. The clumber makes a good pet, especially devoted to one person."
cocker spaniel,"The Cocker Spaniel is primarily a beloved companion dog breed, though he remains a capable bird dog at heart. Beautiful to look at (and labor-intensive to groom), the Cocker's amenable, cheerful disposition also makes him a treat to have in the family. Never more pleased than when he's pleasing you, he's as happy to snuggle on the couch with his favorite adults as to romp in the yard with the kids."

It is almost twice as long as tall, constructed to go to ground after tough quarry. Its hind legs are definitely longer than its front legs. Its gait is free and easy. It has a distinctive coat made up of about two-thirds hardish (not wiry) hair and one-third soft hair, about 2 inches in length.

dingo,"The 'dingo"" (Canis dingo) is a wild canine found in Australia. Its exact ancestry is unknown, but dingoes are classified as their own unique canine species. The dingo is the largest terrestrial predator in Australia, and plays an important role as an apex predator. However, the dingo is seen as a pest by livestock farmers due to attacks on animals. Conversely, their predation on rabbits, kangaroos and rats may be of benefit to graziers.The Dingo has intense eyes that vary in color from yellow to orange. The very mobile, small, rounded ears are naturally erect. The well furred, appearing bushy, tail is relaxed and has good length. The hindquarters are lean and muscular. The coat is soft.

The combination of good looks and hunting ability make the English setter a perfect gentleman's hunting companion. The Laveracks tend to be larger, carry more feathering, often have deeper muzzles and usually hold their tails nearly level when on point. The Llewellins tend to be smaller and faster, with less coat and often larger patches of color. They tend to hold their tails straight up when on point.Bred to cover a lot of area when hunting, the English setter is a lively dog that loves to hunt and run. This is especially true of dogs from field lines. If not given sufficient exercise, they can be overly lively inside. With daily exertion, however, they are calm and tractable house dogs.

german short-haired pointer,"The shorthaired is an all-purpose close-working gun dog that combines agility, power and endurance.

It should have a clean-cut head, graceful outline, strong quarters and an athletic physique. The gait is smooth, light and ground-covering. The coat is short and tough.The German shorthaired pointer's idea of heaven is a day hunting in the field and an evening curled up by its owner's side. This is an active dog that can become frustrated and ""creative"" if not given ample daily exercise, both mental and physical. It is a devoted family pet, although at times it is overly boisterous for small children. Because part of its heritage includes hunting mammals, some can be aggressive to small pets unless raised with them. It is a sensitive breed, responsive to gentle training. Some can whine or bark a lot."
giant schnauzer,"This is a larger, more powerful version of the standard schnauzer. Its body is strong, compact and nearly square, combining great power with agility.

The correct relationship of length of body to height is 12:11. The Golden Retriever is a dog without exaggeration. The Golden Retriever should be evaluated as a working gun dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog's ability to work.The breed's most readily identifiable characteristic is its rich, lustrous golden color. Another essential characteristic is proper temperament. A Golden Retriever is friendly, calm, compliant and compatible with people and other dogs. Goldens are particularly good with children. The Golden Retriever's friendly temperament is reflected in his kindly expression. The Golden Retriever is a powerfully built dog, with a good nose for tracking, a soft mouth, and an eagerness to learn."
